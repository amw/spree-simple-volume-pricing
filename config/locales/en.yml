  progressive_discount_info: By default, a single volume price selected based on the item's quantity is applied to all it's units. Select this option to have a progressively reduced price applied to successive units depending on how many are already in the cart, i.e., the first three at $10 each, the next three at $9 each, and all additional units at $8 apiece.
